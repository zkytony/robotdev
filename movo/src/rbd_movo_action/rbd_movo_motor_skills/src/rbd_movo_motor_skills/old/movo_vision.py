# Handles the computer-vision side of things.
# - takes picture with kinect
# - a UI to let user specify the "origin" of the character image
#   among other things.
# - extract character image from the region;
# - saves the image, which may correspond to the result of writing
#   one stroke.
#   - possibility: get the difference between strokes to extract
#     the stroke by itself.
#
# Note: At the time of writing, the cv2 version used is '3.3.1-dev'.
# The opencv version returned by 'pkg-config --modversion opencv' is
# 2.4.9.
#
# Utilizes cv_bridge ros package to convert ros image message to
# opencv image. Reference:
