This directory contains files for custom projects.  The
entire content of the directory is ignored by git. You can
use this directory to place whatever you like and have that
mirrored and accessible within the docker container's
robotdev directory.

For example, you can put the repositories for your projects here.
Those repositories _won't_ and _shouldn't_ become submodules of robotdev
because only _you_ (or your teammates) need them.
