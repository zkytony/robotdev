# Arm Control

Look at [these examples](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/python/examples/docs/arm_examples)

Experience with different examples:

- Arm Simple `[N]`: the robot stands up, and the arm starts moving. The end effector rotates. The arm did a simple extension. That's it.

- Arm Stow and Unstow `[N]`: the robot stands up. The arm extends (stow). Then returns (unstow).
