# GraphNav Localization

Remember to **upload the graph and its snapshots**.

To localize the robot, there are two options:

  - Initialize localization to the nearest fiducial (must be in sight of a fiducial).
    **The robot needs to see a fiducial marker**

  - Initialize localization to a specific waypoint (must be exactly at the waypoint).
