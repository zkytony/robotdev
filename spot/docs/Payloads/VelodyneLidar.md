**The step-by-step attaching procedure** (for the CORE combined with LiDAR) is [on the official documentation](https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/article/Spot-Enhanced-Autonomy-Package-EAP#AttachingSpotCOREandlidarunittotherobot). The main figure to look at is the one below (click to enlarge):

In essence, you need to slide _three_ t-slot nuts into each mounting rail (see figure below for terminology). The Spot CORE will
occupy the foremost and rearest two nuts on each side, and the LiDAR will occupy the middle one. (Read our [SpotCORE notes](./SpotCORE.md) for details on the t-slot nuts and installing the CORE.)

If you have previously only installed the CORE, then you have to remove the two rear hex screws and then slide in one additional t-slot nut on each rail.

**Note 1:** Pay special attention on how the rear two t-slot nuts are oriented. Please make sure the holes are towards each other, as shown below. Otherwise (from Kaiyu's experience), the CORE and the LiDAR won't both fit.

**Note 2:** Also note that the _spacer_ should be placed between the the hole of a rear mount on Spot and the LiDAR's mounting base. Look at the official LiDAR assembly diagram above.

**Note 3:** When mounting the LiDAR, you should first insert the two long screws, and then screw in the rear two screws.

**Note 4:** Keep the two screws you removed from Spot's rear mount in a safe place.

**Note 5:** When connecting the M12 LiDAR cable to CORE's M12 cable connector, notice that there is a flat edge on the circle that should be aligned. See picture below.
